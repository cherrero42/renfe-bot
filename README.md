# renfe-bot

## Description

Renfe-bot is a handy tool designed to assist users in purchasing train tickets.
Its primary function is to monitor ticket availability, especially in situations
when tickets are sold out and only become available when someone cancels their
reservation. This bot promptly notifies users when there are tickets available
for purchase. While the current version primarily focuses on scraping data,
future developments will include implementing a Telegram chatbot interface for
enhanced user interaction.
